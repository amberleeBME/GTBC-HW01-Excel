### What are some limitations of this dataset?
- There is no demographic information.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create a scatter plot comparing the number of backers to the amount pledged.

### Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully.
The median provides a better summary than the mean because there are extreme outliers that skew the data. The skewness is evident in the standard deviation which is more than 3 times higher than the mean. The standard deviation also shows that there is more variability in successful campaigns (std dev = 844) than unsuccessful campaigns (std dev = 61).
